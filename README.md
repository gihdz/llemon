# Little Lemon Capstone project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

Project implemented during Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course.

Main requirements of the project are the following
* Implement/create a React application based on provided figma designs.
* Implement booking reservation feature for little lemon.
    * Created a booking form to handle reservation input
    * Stored reservation input in the local storage as the API was not working at the time of implementation
    * Using the information stored in the local storage, it disables available time options in the booking form for a better experience


Please note: the only functionality working on this website besides the design is the Reserve a Table function.
